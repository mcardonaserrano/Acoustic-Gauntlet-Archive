# Acoustic-Gauntlet-Archive

_**What is this?**_
This repo is an archive of my 2018 STEM Invention project software that won first place in its category. This code was written when I was in 10th grade and is heavily deprecated, but I have it uploaded for archival purposes.

_**What does it do?**_
The program "acousticgauntlet_final.jar" opens up a program I wrote in Scratch v1.2 (archaic I know) and converted to Java. The program was meant to complement a pair of custom-designed gloves and allows the user to play an 'air guitar' using various hand gestures.

# How to use:

Keys **Q W E R** control notes _E A D G B Em_, using gestures.

Keys **1-4** control guitar frets _1-8_.

See "AcousticGauntletPoster.jpeg" for a handy visual guide.
